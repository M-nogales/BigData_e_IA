When is the dollar or the economic system going to collapse?
And I've said in previous videos, the trouble with fake money is it makes the rich richer, but it makes the poor and middle class poorer.
If this collapses, as you know right now, crime is increasing in America severely because people can't survive because this is fake money.
They're not safe because it's all fake money.
They're not safe, stupid, because it's fake money.
So that's why I say to people, go to what's real.
It just crashes down, because right now the people who own most of our bonds are Chinese and Japanese.
So that's why I save gold, silver, and have a lot of Bitcoin.
The people I'm concerned about are my generation, younger guys, because they don't know anything about it.
And the reason Bitcoin is doing so well is because my generation or generation before, America is now the biggest debtor nation in history.
They don't talk about how they're gonna handle that debt.
I'm getting richer as the dollar goes down.
But my age group, the old boomer guys, we have no idea what's going on and they choose to be stupid and poor.
But the old guys just are not getting it.
Why do you think the old people don't get it?
And that when I was 18 years old, our silver coins, like the quarters and half dollars, turned into fake money.
That was 1965.
I don't know what's wrong with people.
They can't get it.
They can't get it.
